// Will add code agter this update:

//  Game Profile things:
//  Account creation with G-mail i don't know how. (If you can manage to create backend or have to go with diff approach.)
//  - Acc will have game insides like high score, played games & stuffs.
//  - Profile has it's card so they can share it. [If no backend then store it in localstorage.]
//  - Every profile has it's own Player card which is not designed yet. With some cool profile.
//  - Some profile are inbuild & player can install their own, too. (2nd one will happen if we can create a backend unless, try localstorage or no.ðŸ¥²)
//  - Game card has cool look with promotional material or marketing thing inside it.
//  - There's a + sign at last which will redirect to form if they want us to add some game or idea or short of thing


// The BG code for Focus mode. (If i want to go in that side.)
//      - Like blocking site.
//      - Blocking the auto-close thing.
//      - Extras remover. [F*uk this is the hardest feature.]
//      -
